{"name":"Why I want to Work for Screenleap?","tagline":"Customer Support Representative - my views on why I might be a good fit.","body":"### Hello Screenleap team,\r\n\r\nThis evening, while I was browsing Hacker News, I saw your recruitment post. To be honest, I was not looking for a job. However, I was curious to learn more about Screenleap. I instantly loved the concept of the product: screen-sharing in web without any software installation and also allowing third-party developers to integrate screen-sharing into their apps using Screenleap's API. Then I started thinking why I loved the concept so much and here are the following two reasons I came up with:  \r\n\r\nFirst, screen-sharing in web requires log in to G+ Hangout or Skype, so far my personal experience tells me The process creates friction such as log in, password, and waiting for my friend to join Skype or Hangout (I remotely collaborate with him for programming). It's a frustrating process. Screenleap solves it. Brilliant and loved it!\r\n\r\nSecond, I don't know how easily Google hangout API allows third-party developers to integrate screen-sharing into their apps compared to that of Screeleap. However, Google's inconsistent attitude toward supporting third-party APIs (thinking of Google's numerous decisions to shut down several of their services and bring abrupt changes in technology stacks e.g. Angular JS framework) made me think that Screenleap can be THE reliable platform for providing screen-sharing API support among the developer community ( the ultimate winner of Twillo for screen-sharing space!). \r\n\r\nBased on these two points, I decided I should give it a try to work at Screenleap. Then, I looked at the team. The team is amazing. I can learn, grow and flourish working with you while providing my absolute best quality of work and I have no doubt about such prospect if I am given the opportunity. \r\n\r\nA little introduction about myself although I have also applied via the link provided in Hackernews. In past, I worked for [Backpack (YC S14) ] (https://backpackbang.com), facilitatingthe marketing and customer support in its early days. It was founded by two of my high school friends. Last year, I founded a collaborative writing platform [Ryte Club] (https://ryte.club) with another friend of mine. However, the project is unfinished and  we haven't launched it yet. Since my friend has a full-time job, it's kind of uncertain where the project is leading us to next few months. I see it a hobby project that I will pursue in my leisure time. SO, what I have to offer:\r\n\r\nWorking for Backpack and for my own start-up has enabled me to develop a comprehensive understanding of start-up space. From marketing, customer support, promotion, user-query answering, front-end development or household chores, I have done them all. I am curious and passionate about learning. Even if I may lack few skills, I assure that I am a fast-learner and I will catch up to the expectation. On another note, I am attending Stanford this summer and am trying to transfer next fall. I am originally from Bangladesh and came at US for my undergrad. I am moving to SF bay area on May 18, 2015 for my summer semester at Stanford. Since remote working is okay for this job,I believe that I can make it work and deliver my best for Screenleap if given the opportunity. I will be really glad to meet the Screenleap team in person. I dearly look forward to this opportunity. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMarjuk \r\n\r\n[Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marjuk-ahmad/31/b40/6a6)\r\n\r\nEmail: marjuk@stanford.edu \r\n\r\nCell: 802-855-3530 ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
